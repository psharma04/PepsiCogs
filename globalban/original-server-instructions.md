# How to set up PepsiBot to use the GlobalBan system in your server
> This is now only for servers which added PepsiBot before April 26, 2022.

1. Click on PepsiBot's username.
2. Click "Add to Server" (yes, even if it's already in the server).

3. Select your server in the popup, then click "Continue".  Note that you might get prompted to put in your 2FA code (only for servers which have "require 2FA for moderators" enabled).

4. Make sure the bot is being granted "Administrator" permissions (it should be the only checkbox there), then click Authorize.

After this, you should have a screen which says "Authorized" with a big green tick. If not, please DM me (hyperbolicblurple#1337).

Congratulations, PepsiBot Global Ban list should now be working in your server!
